@Hint1=Nobody knows what started the Final War. It was over too fast, fought with the last of the belligerent nations nuclear stockpiles, and the ones who pulled the triggers didn't survive.
@Hint2=Half a century of wars using nukes, bio-weapons, nano-weapons, and even kinetic-kill weapons, gave us the empty world - a population of 100 million and falling fast.
@Hint3=It was the Final War because after that there was really nobody left who wanted to fight; we were all too busy surviving.
@Hint4=Who's to blame? Depends on who you are, but you could just as easily blame the weapons industry; by the end, virtually every arms dealer in the world was owned by Amalgamated Corporation.
